Ironic - The Real Java driver
======

Ironic is an Incubated OpenStack project which aims to provision
bare metal machines instead of virtual machines, forked from the
Nova Baremetal driver. This fork is intended to ease the life of
system administrators and cloud develpoers by enabling a X10
Driver for Ironic, using this Ironic driver and X10 enabled
hardware you will be able to deploy a cup of coffee, as easily
as you can deploy a vm. With the proper orchestration (heat,
salt, chef) it would be possible to deploy a entire meal.
